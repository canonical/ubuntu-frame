# Ubuntu Frame configuration options

This document provides a reference for the configuration options for Ubuntu Frame.

(ubuntu-frame-configuration-options.md#snap-configuration-options)=

## Snap configuration options

There are four snap configuration options:

- `daemon=[true|false]` enables the daemon (defaults to true on Ubuntu Core and false on classic systems)
- `launcher=[true|false]` enables a side bar application switcher if your solution calls for that
- `config=<contents for frame.config>`
- `display=<contents for frame.display>`

### `daemon`

This controls the `ubuntu-frame.daemon` process. If `daemon=true` then the daemon runs and *takes control of the display on your computer*, otherwise the daemon is disabled.

On a default installation `daemon` is only set to `true` on Ubuntu Core systems. But can be set to `true` either manually or from a gadget snap.

You can see the value of this using the following command:

```bash
$ snap get ubuntu-frame daemon
```

Or set it using

```bash
$ snap set ubuntu-frame daemon=true
```

### `launcher`

```{tip}
This feature is only available on **Intel**, **AMD** and **ARM64** systems
```

```{tip}
This feature is only available from Frame version **187** onward
```

This controls whether a side bar application switcher ("Launcher" from Unity Desktop design) is displayed. If your solution requires multiple applications that the user needs to be able to switch between, this will enable that - displaying a side bar with clickable application icons.

```bash
# Until https://github.com/canonical/snapd/pull/14331 gets released
$ snap refresh snapd --channel edge/ubuntu-core-desktop

# Give Frame access to application metadata and icons
$ snap connect ubuntu-frame:desktop-launch

# Enable the launcher
$ snap set ubuntu-frame launcher=true
```

Make sure that the applications you want to run are annotated with metadata and icons appropriately, see Snapcraft's {doc}`snapcraft:how-to/crafting/configure-package-information` documentation to get your app icons to display.

```{tip}
Since version **211**, you can use `Mir` or `UbuntuFrame` in [`OnlyShowIn=` and `NotShowIn=`](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/recognized-keys.html) to control visibility of the icon on different environments. This is useful to hide the daemon app in snaps that are also useful outside of the Frame ecosystem.
```

### `config`

This provides a way to modify the Frame configuration file. Every time the option is set the provided config is merged with the default config and written to the file. The default file looks like this:

```bash
$ cat /var/snap/ubuntu-frame/current/frame.config
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
# USE 'snap set ubuntu-frame config=...' INSTEAD

# ** Options supplied through config (begin) **
# (none)
# ** Options supplied through config (end) **

# Required to run as daemon
console-provider=vt

# Virtual terminal to use for display (0 to use current)
vt=4

# Mouse pointer to use (auto|null|software)
cursor=auto

# As frame HAS to run mesa-kms we can safely override the probe for KMS everywhere
env-hacks=MIR_MESA_KMS_DISABLE_MODESET_PROBE
```

By default `config` is unset, but you can, for instance, change the "wallpaper" color as follows:

```bash
$ snap set ubuntu-frame config="
wallpaper-top=0x92006a
wallpaper-bottom=0xdd4814
"
```

Another option that is useful for some applications (such as games) is to enable the Wayland extensions for cursor confinement as follows:

```bash
$ snap set ubuntu-frame config="
add-wayland-extensions=zwp_pointer_constraints_v1:zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1
"
```

Each "set" command overwrites the previous content, so if you're combining config options, put them all into the same "set" command:

```bash
$ snap set ubuntu-frame config="
wallpaper-top=0x92006a
wallpaper-bottom=0xdd4814
add-wayland-extensions=zwp_pointer_constraints_v1:zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1
"
```

A full list of the current configuration options supported by `ubuntu-frame` can be obtained by `--help`:

```
$ ubuntu-frame --help
usage: /snap/ubuntu-frame/3926/usr/local/bin/frame [options]

Command-line options (e.g. "--wayland-host=wayland-0").

Environment variables capitalise long form with prefix "MIR_SERVER_" and "_" in place of "-".
(E.g. "MIR_SERVER_WAYLAND_HOST=wayland-0")

Config file entries are long form (e.g. "wayland-host=wayland-0").
The config file (frame.config) is located via the XDG Base Directory Specification.
($XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config followed by $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS)

                                        clients before compositing). Higher
                                        values result in lower latency but risk
                                        causing frame skipping. Default: A
                                        negative value means decide

  --console-provider arg (=auto)        Console device handling
                                        How Mir handles console-related tasks
                                        (device handling, VT switching, etc)
                                        Options:

                                        not need raw device access and which
                                        don't have a VT concept
                                        auto: detect the appropriate provider.

                                        run on or 0 to use current.

                                        `all` to enable all supported

                                        $HOME/.config, followed by
                                        $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS)

  -h [ --help ]                         this help text
```

You might notice that the options are described as "command-line options", and they also can be supplied that way when running the snap from the command-line (and not as a daemon). That can be a convenient way of testing their effect. (See {ref}`run-ubuntu-frame-in-your-desktop-environment` for an example).

### `display`

If the `display` option is unset when Ubuntu Frame starts, it will populate the `display` snap configuration option according to the hardware on your device. Here's an example (which will probably not match your device precisely).

```yaml
# $ snap get ubuntu-frame display
layouts:
# keys here are layout labels (used for atomically switching between them).
# The yaml anchor 'the_default' is used to alias the 'default' label

  default:
    cards:
    # a list of cards (currently matched by card-id)

    - card-id: 0
      eDP-1:
        # This output supports the following modes: 1920x1080@60.0
        #
        # Uncomment the following to enforce the selected configuration.
        # Or amend as desired.
        #
        state: enabled       # {enabled, disabled}, defaults to enabled
        mode: 1920x1080@60.0 # Defaults to preferred mode
        position: [0, 0]     # Defaults to [0, 0]
        orientation: normal  # {normal, left, right, inverted}, defaults to normal
        scale: 1
        group: 0 # Outputs with the same non-zero value are treated as a single display

      HDMI-A-1:
        # (disconnected)

      DisplayPort-1:
        # (disconnected)

      HDMI-A-2:
        # (disconnected)

      DisplayPort-2:
        # (disconnected)

      HDMI-A-3:
        # (disconnected)

  side_by_side:
    cards:
    # a list of cards (currently matched by card-id)

    - card-id: 0
      eDP-1:
        # This output supports the following modes: 1920x1080@60.0
        #
        # Uncomment the following to enforce the selected configuration.
        # Or amend as desired.
        #
        state: enabled       # {enabled, disabled}, defaults to enabled
        mode: 1920x1080@60.0 # Defaults to preferred mode
        position: [0, 0]     # Defaults to [0, 0]
        orientation: normal  # {normal, left, right, inverted}, defaults to normal
        scale: 1
        group: 0             # Outputs with the same non-zero value are treated as a single display

      HDMI-A-1:
        # (disconnected)

      DisplayPort-1:
        # (disconnected)

      HDMI-A-2:
        # (disconnected)

      DisplayPort-2:
        # (disconnected)

      HDMI-A-3:
        # (disconnected)
```

You can see that two `layout` entries are provided `default` and `side_by_side`. But you can edit these entries, or add your own.

If you need to reset this configuration (because your hardware changes, or you make a mistake) then simply unset it and restart Ubuntu Frame:

```
$ snap unset ubuntu-frame display
$ snap restart ubuntu-frame
$ snap get ubuntu-frame display
...
```

### `display-layout`

By default Ubuntu Frame uses the `default` layout described above. But you can change this to another layout in the `display` configuration using the `display-layout` configuration option. For example:

```
$ snap set ubuntu-frame display-layout=side_by_side
```
