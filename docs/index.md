# Ubuntu Frame

Ubuntu Frame is an easy to use, reliable and secure display server for embedded Linux devices allowing developers to deploy their graphic applications for kiosks, digital signage and more.

With Ubuntu Frame, the graphic application you choose or design gets a fullscreen window. It also automatically enables windows behaviours, input from touch, keyboard, and mouse, on-screen keyboard, power saving and more. Ubuntu Frame bundles communication protocols, input protocols, and security policies into a single kit, which can then be used in embedded devices.

Ubuntu Frame streamlines the build and development of products that need graphical output. With Ubuntu Frame, developers don't have to deal with drivers, input modalities, windows dynamics and rules. No more integrating DRM, KMS, input protocols and security policies. This means less code to manage, fewer opportunities for bugs and fewer vulnerabilities in untried code, with more time for developing the content of the display.

Ubuntu Frame is for anyone looking to deploy graphic interfaces for embedded Linux devices such as IoT devices, robots, smart home devices, kiosks, and more.

## Benefits

- Create maintainable images for kiosks and digital signage solutions in under an hour.
- Out of the box features such as kiosk mode, on-screen keyboard and power saving for making the perfect shell for touchscreen kiosks.
- Less code for you to integrate and maintain as it bundles communication protocols, input protocols, and security policies into a single kit
- Compatible with popular toolkits for creating graphical user interfaces like Qt, Flutter, electron, and also html5 and java.
- Built-in security and long term supported by Canonical.
