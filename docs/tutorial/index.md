# Tutorials

These documents will take you through the ecosystem, familiarizing you with how a Ubuntu Frame deployment is structured.
To build a custom solution, there's also a guide on integrating your own applications.

## Quick start with Ubuntu Frame

To get started, the easiest thing you can do with it is to {ref}`run a secure web kiosk <make-a-secure-ubuntu-web-kiosk>`.

## Integrating your own application

For a more involved tutorial on deploying your graphical application using Wayland, check out our {ref}`developer tutorial <tutorial-deploy-graphical-application>`.
